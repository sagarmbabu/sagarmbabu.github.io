    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a Business & Data Analyst focused on turning raw data into clear insights and practical reporting that teams can use.
      I work across the full analytics flow—data extraction, transformation, modeling, and dashboarding—with a strong focus on
      reliability, performance, and stakeholder usability.
    </p>

    <p>
      My day-to-day tools include <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong>, <strong>Databricks (PySpark)</strong>, and <strong>Snowflake</strong>.
      I build KPI dashboards, automate reporting pipelines, and support self-service analytics through well-designed data models
      (including <strong>star schema</strong>) and clean metric definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve worked in banking and financial services environments on analytics and reporting initiatives, collaborating with business users
      to translate requirements into dashboards, datasets, and insights that support operational and strategic decisions.
